# Grocery-Budget-Manager
Defining the issue

My client is Ms. Carter. She is a teacher at the Marsh Creek Detention Facility which is a juvenile detention center in Contra Costa County. She teaches incarcerated adults the basic skills they need to reintegrate into society and gain meaningful employment. She wants to start teaching her students the importance of budgeting in terms of purchasing food. She wants to do this by giving “students... an amount of money that they are allowed to spend per week on food.”   

She noticed that in her own life she often has issues with food spoiling in her refrigerator. She explained that oftentimes she is not aware of the foods that are in the fridge nor when they expire. This causes her to exceed her weekly budget and buy food she already has. 

Acknowledging the fact that she has had this issue in her own life, she found it imperative that her students learn how to manage a grocery budget. She wanted to create a program that effectively teaches students how to do so, while reflecting after the activity through written responses.


Rationale for proposed situation

For the students there will be a box where they input the amount of money they have to spend for the week. They will then click the food in the grocery store that they want and need in their households. The price of the food will subtract from the initial amount the student input. Immediately checking students' answers is time consuming, so my program will submit the students' responses to a database. This way, Ms.Carter can access the responses from her home. 

Javascript is the best language to program this application in because it is a client-side language. The code is executed on the user’s processor without needing the server side processing. This allows the bandwidth to be conserved because the code does not need to be processed in the site’s web server and sent back to the user. Lastly, the syntax of javascript is easy to understand and it can run on many different types of hardware. 

I chose to use Mongoose (along with MongoDB and Node.js installations) because it provides a schema based way for me to structure my application data. This program helps me to manage the relationships between my data.
